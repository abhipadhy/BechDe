BechDe is a peer to peer online marketplace for college students to stay connected and be able to buy and sell used products based on their comfort. This exchange of products can be done online from our portal. Today with E-Commerce and Online Marketplace gaining attraction in the digital world, more platforms like BechDe will be up and coming in the not so foreseeable future. Our aim is to make lives of students simpler and generate value for all. The students who intend to buy from our platform will be able to trust on the quality of the product they buy since they are buying from a fellow student. 

Our platform makes exchange of products easier for students which can be done completely online. Users can create an account on our platform and post his/her product along with the basic product details. A student can either buy that product from the seller or rent on a monthly basis. The buyer will also be rewarded with 5 BechDe points on each transaction of Rs.100 made on our platform which can be redeemed on a shop associated with us. The seller can view the analytics for each product. We have integrated RazorPay to make payments easier on our platform. The seller will be informed via mail upon the successful purchase of his/her product.
